            <h2>About Child Labor</h2>
            <p>Child labor is the employment of children in any work that deprives them of their childhood, interferes with their ability to attend regular school, and is harmful to their physical and mental development. It is a violation of their basic rights.</p>
            <p>Millions of children around the world are engaged in various forms of child labor, including hazardous work that exposes them to dangerous conditions. Child labor is often driven by poverty, lack of access to education, and social and cultural factors.</p>
